<p>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</p>
<p>I learned how boolean algebra works. The big idea is all about logic.</p>

<p>What challenges did I encounter?</p>
<p>I did not encounter any major challenges because I was able to follow the wiki well.</p>

<p>How could this experience be improved?</p>
<p>It was good how it was. I do not think it could be improved.</p>

<p>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?</p>
<p>Although the topic is difficult, I have learned all about boolean algebra. It has impacted my thinking into more logical based instead of number based.</p>
