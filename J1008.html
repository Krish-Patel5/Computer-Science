<p>I learned basic commands to use within this program in mission manager. The big idea is to learn the beginning to this software.</p>

<p>What challenges did I encounter?</p>
<p>I did not encounter any major challenges because I was able to follow the wiki well.</p>

<p>How could this experience be improved?</p>
<p>It was good how it was. I do not think it could be improved.</p>

<p>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?</p>
<p>I am able to understand the commands very easily now. When given directions, I can follow with ease. Although it can be confusing sometimes, it is still not too difficult wokring out mission manager.</p>
