<h4>I received assistance from: Mrs.Jang<h4>

<p>I assisted: No One</p>

<p>1.1:</p>
<p>The World Wide Web and network printing occasionally is what I use.</p> 

<p>2.1:</p>
<p>It can be important because both Jack and john can make different files within the directory. It can also help organize everything.</p>

<p>3.1:
<p>The home directory is very important because it is the main directory which is why there is a symbol.</p>

<p>4.1:
<p>The promt changed and it it is helpful because it can show that you are in a directory.</p>

<p>5.1:
<p>When you press the up arrow, you go to a past command you typed.</p>

<p>5.2:</p>
<p>When you press the down arrow, it goes to a more recent command.</p>

<p>6.1:</p>
<p>It was not because it is now a file. The text is probably within the file.</p>

<p>7.1</p>
<p>The tree command can show directories and files and show which files go in which directory. ls can show what is in a directory.</p>

<p>7.2</p>
<p>When you want to know everything, you would use tree. When you only want to know a single file in a directory, you would use ls.</p>

<p>8.1</p>
<p>Sleep can make commands delayed when needed. The argument to sleep can allow something to happen before the new command.</p>

<p>8.2</p>
<p>The reason this is, is because there are instances where it is needed. When shutting a computer down the stuff in hte back has to turn off first. It is similar to a computer shutting down.</p>

<p>9.1</p>
<p>It is not different than what I expected.</p>

<p>9.2</p>
<p>You are able to run other commands while it is running in the back.</p>

<p>9.3</p>
<p>The numbers might represent that specific sleep command if there is more than one.</p>

<p>10.1</p>
<p>I observe that it shows the sleep command.</p>

<p>10.2</p>
<p>It shows if it is still running or if it is finished.</p>

<p>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</p>
<p>I learned basic commands to use within this program. The big idea is to learn the beginning to this software.</p>

<p>What challenges did I encounter?</p>
<p>I did not encounter any major challenges because I was able to follow the wiki well.</p>

<p>How could this experience be improved?</p>
<p>It was good how it was. I do not think it could be improved.</p>

<p>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?</p>
<p>I am able to understand the commands very easily now. When given directions, I can follow with ease.</p>
