<h4>I received assistance from: No one.<h4>

<p>I assisted: No one.</p>

<p>1.1:Git is communicating to me all of my information. Name, date, and the token.</p>

<p>1.2:It both says “Adding out first file in this tutorial”</p>

<p>1.3 This may be because it is showing what we said in the first file.</p>

<p>2.1:File1.txt is displayed as in the modified section while file2.txt is in the new file section</p>

<p>2.2: They are not displayed in the same section because one was created before and modified while the other is just new and not modified.</p>

<p>3.1:Now there are 2 file1.txt, one being a new file, while the other remaining as modified. The file2.txt still remains the same as a new file.</p>

<p>3.2:Files are displayed in ways such as being a new file or being modified. In this case, file1 is modified as well as a new file while file2 is a new file. It can show what files are new and which ones you have changed before.</p>

<p>4.1: It shows each file and what is in them. It goes through file 1 first and then the second one. It says that 2 files have been changed.</p>

<p>4.2:Some specific differences displayed between the files are the text that is written. It shows a bunch of text in white then a cyan text, and then the words written in green. The cyan text is also different along with the white text. The cyan text has a - when something is removed and a + when something is added.</p>

<p>5.1: It shows what has changed in the files. It says that something was removed from file 1. The “This file isn't empty” part. Everything else remains the same.</p>


<p>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</p>
<p>I learned a lot about git and how to use it.</p>

<p>What challenges did I encounter?</p>
<p>I did not encounter any challenges.</p>

<p>How could this experience be improved?</p>
<p>This experience could not be improved.</p>

<p>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?</p>
<p>It has impacted my thinking by changing how I learn. I have to read along and follow the commands at the same time which helps a lot.</p>
